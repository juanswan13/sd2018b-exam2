## Expected results
* Develop artifact automatic building for Continous Delivery  
* Use libraries of programming languages to perform specific tasks   
* Diagnose and execute the needed actions to achieve a stable infrastructure  

## Used technologies
* Docker  
* CentOS7 Box
* Github Repository
* Python3
* Python3 Libraries: Flask, Fabric
* Ngrok  

## Infrastructure diagram  
The desired infrastructure to deploy consists in three Docker Containers and one Docker Client with the following settings:

* Python:3.6-slim CI Server: this CT has a Flask application with and endpoint using RESTful architecture best practices. The endpoint has the following logic:   
  * A Webhook attached to a Pull Request triggers the endpoint.  
  * The endpoint reads the Pull Request content and validates if the PR is mergedd  
  * If merged, via the Docker Python SDK, the endpoint runs the required commands to build the Docker Artifact and push it to the local registry.  
* wernight/ngrok Ngrok: this CT creates a temporary public domain name to expose the CI Server's endpoint.  
* registry Registry: this CT is a private local registry where the created artifacts will be pushed.  
* Windows 10 Home Docker Client: this Docker Client will be used to pull the private registry's artifacts.

## Introduction  

The current branch contains two key elements to deploy the infrastructure. The first one is the docker-compose.yml. This file contains the provisioning required for each CT. The second one is the ci_server folder that contains the Dockerfile and python script to build the CI Server Docker image. 

### docker-compose.yml:
the docker-compose.yml contains three services, that will be described above  
  
* **Registry:** This service refers to the private local Registry for Docker images that we are creating. It uses the a Docker image called Registry that Docker already provide to create this type of servers, it is attached to the port 443. It also has two self-signed SSL certificates created with OpenSSL. These certificates  allow the server to be secure and that clients can trust in it. they are located at ./certs.
